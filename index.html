        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ivo Nikolov. I live in Sofia and I have been a Software
          developer for more than 8 years. I have worked on Mobile and Web
          Applications. I have been a leading developer for RSC for more than 3
          years and have contributed to the <b>Stork Mobile Application</b>.
          Also I love the <i>LOTR</i> trilogy and we cannot talk if you do not
          like it. Worst moment of my life was when I received an Arsenal
          football shirt instead of the Manchester United t-short. It was not
          even the a good one, it was the one with th O2 logo and I remember it
          costed 199.50 leva.
